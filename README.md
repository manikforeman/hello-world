# hello-world
It's the classic intro

I'm starting a site because I've always wanted to, but I never had the motivation to do so. Right now I'm just playing around and getting experience, but I hope to use this site to host content for my journey to space, direct potential employers to it and just generally begin to market myself more.

I graduated from Shippensburg University in 2018 with a BS in Physics with minors in Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics, Spanish, French, and Military Science. The same morning I graduated, I also commissioned into the US Army as an active duty Military Intelligence Officer. Right now I work for the Ship ROTC program as a Gold Bar Recruiter and manage their social media platforms, which is where my interest in marketing myself began. It's also possibly where it ends, but I might as well go all in while I'm in the mood. Nawm talm bout?

My brother, a fellow Ship '18 graduate and one of their inaugural class of Electrical Engineering majors, also created a <a href = "http://micforeman.com"> website </a> today that will surely be better coded and looking, but hey. We all have to start somewhere.
